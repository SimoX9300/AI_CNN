### **AI CNN Project: CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks**

---

#### **1. Overview**
This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset consists of 60,000 images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to train a CNN to accurately classify the images and compare two modelsâ€”one underperforming and another optimized with techniques like early stopping and data augmentation.
